// EXERCISE 11
// Return an array of withdrawal sums of each bank account.
// If the account doesn't have withdrawals, it's sum is 0.
// Array example: bankAccounts in /data/data.js
// getAllWithdrawals(bankAccounts) => [3432, 0, 43242.34, 0, 23432]

export function getAllWithdrawals(array) {
  // Your code goes here...
  const withdrawal=[];
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i].withdrawals && array[i].withdrawals.length > 0) {
      let sum = 0;
      for (let j = 0; j < array[i].withdrawals.length; j++) {
        sum += array[i].withdrawals[j];
      }
      withdrawal.push(sum);
    } else {
      withdrawal.push(0);
    }
  }
  return withdrawal;
}

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-11"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
